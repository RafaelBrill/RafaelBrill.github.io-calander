Welcome to your simple calendar. This calendar generates the present day. I was ask to build a calendar that saves data in a local storage. Before I tried to add my own twist but my grade reflected that I should stick with what it is assigned rather than challenging a different concept but same out come. This time, by looking and at the image provided, I came up with a identical twin like calendar. This calendar has dynamic using boostrap with some vanilla css, I use javascript to add the local storage and added the "this" method to choose the only button/text box to input information.

Directions: 
1. Type anything on the grey area
2. Once you typed something click the lock button to save it in your local storage
3. Refresh your page and you will see your schedule will be saved exactly the way you left it.
